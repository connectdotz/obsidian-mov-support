# Obsidian MOV Support 

A non-intrusive [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin to view and play embedded `.mov` file inline for all platforms. 

## How to use it?

Just [install](#installation) the plugin; that's it. 

After installation, all embedded `.mov` files should be rendered like other supported video formats. 

This plugin is **non-intrusive** and only intercepts the rendering process. It will not change the attachment filenames or the file contents.

### Settings
You can selectively turn on/off the `MOV Support` for LivePreview and Preview modes in the Settings tab.
